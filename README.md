Flatiron School Phase 3 Project
by Harris, Ibrahima, and Nick

We made a PokeDex App using React, Ruby, Active Record, and Sinatra. Our project for Phase 3 of FlatIron School's software engineering program Fall '21 - Winter '22

This app should display a set amount of Pokemon that we currently have seen and are in our database. Users can access our Pokedex and specific Pokemon from the browser, using URLS such as "Pokemon/all" & "Pokemon/:id (meaning their specific ID number)".

If you cannot find the Pokemon you are looking for, Users can add new Pokemon to our dex through our "Add New Pokemon" button.
